Time complexity of Quick Sort is  Average/Best Ω(n log(n)): Worst o(n^2)
Space complexity: log(n)

Worst Case: The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks greatest
or smallest element as pivot. If we consider above partition strategy where last element is always picked as pivot, the worst case
would occur when the array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Following is recurrence for worst case.

Best Case: The best case occurs when the partition process always
picks the middle element as pivot. Following is recurrence for best case.
